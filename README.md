### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Linear Regression model to predict Weekly_Sales for different Walmart stores and departments based on historical data and external factors like temperature, fuel prices, and holidays.

### Dataset Information
Data taken from the Walmart Recruiting - Store Sales Forecasting competition on Kaggle.

### Main files used:
train.csv: historical sales data by store and department.

features.csv: includes economic indicators like temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.

stores.csv: provides metadata about store type and size.

### Model: Linear Regression

Built using Scikit-learn.

Trained on preprocessed features to predict Weekly_Sales.

### Evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score
